# iPhone-Manager
---
A Python Discord bot to monitor and have some control over iPhone's connected to a Mac by USB.
To be used along side RDM. 


## Features
---
iPhone-Manager will generate a list of iPhones from your RDM manager SQLite database(s).
The list will contain the iPhone name, UUID and a generated ID for each iPhone.
iPhone-Manager will only accept commands from the Discord role you set and only post in a channel you set.
All config settings are in a YAML file.

+ Manage your iphone's by taking screenshot's and have them upload to Discord.
+ Have RDM rebuild and restart Pogo on an iPhone
+ Kill usbmuxd on the Mac (it will auto restart), which should have all iPhone's rebuild.
+ Reboot or shutdown your iPhone
+ Take a screenshot of your Mac and upload to Discord


### Prerequisites
---
iPhone Manager is made using Python3 and will require :

pyyaml

discord

psutil

Xcode 10.2.1>

You will also need libimobiledevice installed on the Mac.


### Troubleshooting libimobiledevice
---
After install of libimobiledevice, check it's working. You can test by taking a screenshot on an iPhone. Connect the iPhone to your Mac and get it's UUID from Xcode, in terminal type:
idevicescreenshot -u your-uuid-of-iphone  This will save a screenshot of the connected iPhone. If you get the error "Could not connect to lockdownd, error code -21"
